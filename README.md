# Deleted-Files

Deleted Files is a clothing brand targeted to teens and young adults, which was created by Riley Kimpel and Peyton Anderson in 2017. Our website is set up to be a responsive catalog for the Brand, including info about the brand, contact info, a Shop All page, and lookbooks for their 2018 year.

Home: The home page is a simple, to-the-point list of links to other pages of the site, to allow for easy navigation and browsing. The page is set on a black background, for simplicity, with white text for the title/links, chosen to stand out against the background. With the :hover attribute, we've also made it so that the links change to red when hovered over with the cursor.

Shop All: The Shop All page is a page-width-responsive catalog of every product Deleted Files currently offers, including every product from both the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter Lookbooks. It consists of fairly simply linked .jpg images, ordered into columns. This page, as well as every other beside the homepage, has a navbar set in the top-left of the page, which has a layout identical to the Homepage's navlist.

Contact: The contact page includes links to the brand's Twitter, as well as their Instagram account. The links are in a bold white font set in the center of the screen.

About: The About page gives general information on the background and inspiration for Deleted Files. The information is set in the center of the page, with an image of the brand founders set to the bottom-left. The image has the borders rounded, for aesthetic reasons.

2018 Spring/Summer Lookbook, 2018 Fall/Winter Lookbook: These pages showcase seasonal brand items. Anything not found on these pages is included in the Shop All page, along with all of these items. These pages were created to allow more organized, streamlined browsing.
